# Changelog

All notable changes to `__MODULE_REPO__` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Manual `workflow_dispatch` release override.** `release.yml` now
  accepts a `bump_type` (patch/minor/major) input to force a release
  through `workbench-core`'s reusable `module-release.yml`, regardless of
  what Conventional Commits since the last tag would compute — a floor,
  never a downgrade of a higher severity already pending. Manual dispatch
  only runs from `main`. See `workbench-core`'s `docs/decisions-log.md` D67.
